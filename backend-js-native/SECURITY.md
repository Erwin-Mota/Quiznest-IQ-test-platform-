## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

**Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put other users at risk.

### 2. Report privately

Please report security vulnerabilities privately by:

- **Email**: security@iqtest.com
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Direct Message**: Contact the maintainers directly

### 3. Include the following information

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a suggested fix (optional)

### 4. Response timeline

We will respond to security reports within:

- **Initial response**: 24 hours
- **Status update**: 72 hours
- **Resolution**: 7-14 days (depending on severity)

### 5. Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Vulnerabilities will be disclosed after a fix is available
- We will credit researchers who report vulnerabilities (if desired)
- We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. **Validate all inputs**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
3. **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information
5. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update npm packages
6. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
7. **Implement logging**: Log security events for monitoring
8. **Follow OWASP guidelines**: Adhere to OWASP security practices

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords**: Minimum 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
2. **Enable 2FA**: Use two-factor authentication when available
3. **Keep software updated**: Use the latest version of the application
4. **Report suspicious activity**: Report any suspicious behavior immediately
5. **Use secure networks**: Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive operations

## Security Monitoring

We implement comprehensive security monitoring:

- **Audit logging**: All security events are logged
- **Error tracking**: Sentry integration for error monitoring
- **Performance monitoring**: OpenTelemetry for observability
- **Health checks**: Continuous health monitoring
- **Metrics collection**: Security metrics and KPIs

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate response**: Contain the incident
2. **Assessment**: Assess the scope and impact
3. **Notification**: Notify affected users if necessary
4. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and patches
5. **Post-incident review**: Conduct post-incident analysis
6. **Documentation**: Document lessons learned

## Security Updates

Security updates are released:

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Within 24 hours
- **High severity**: Within 72 hours
- **Medium severity**: Within 1 week
- **Low severity**: Within 1 month

## Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@iqtest.com
- **GitHub**: Use private vulnerability reporting
- **Response time**: 24 hours for initial response
